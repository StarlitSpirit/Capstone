This folder contains all of the files that were used to the Zeeman and Paschen-Back splititng lab report. Each numbered folder contains the data collected at that helium wavelength, its respective calibration data, and the code used to extract the data and find delta lambda. It's organized this way because each subfolder has fiels of the same name and MATLAB files have to be in the same file as the data you are trying to access.In the main folder, there is a MATLAB folder that uses the pixel distance of delta lambda, converts this to nm, and graphs this data compared to B and lambda squared as well as find curve fits for these lines. The slopes of these is used to find bohr magneton.
